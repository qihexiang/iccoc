It is our great pleasure to invite you to the International Conference of Computational Organometallic Catalysis (ICCOC2023), which will be held in Beijing, China, from 27th October to 30th October 2023. This is an international conference dedicated to promoting advances in the integration of theoretical and computational chemistry with homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis involving transition metals.

- The International Conference on Computational Organometallic Catalysis 2023 (ICCOC2023) focuses on the application of theoretical and computational chemistry in homogeneous and hetergeneous organometallic catalysis. Advances covered range from new catalyzed reactions and processes, to ligand and catalyst design, and new mechanistic insights that could change implementation into practice.
- Participants include scientists involved in theoretical and computational chemistry related to catalysis, organometallic chemistry, organic synthesis, polymers etc., from both academia and industry. The ICCOC2023 is trying to provide a platform to exchange academic ideas in this field with a highly engaged discussion. The single oral session and one poster session style for oral presentations and posters promote discussion and debate, as does the conference size (typically 100-150 participants).

## Important dates:

- Abstract Submission Deadline: Sept. 30th, 2023
- Registration Deadline: Sept. 30th, 2023
- Conference Date: Oct. 27th-30th, 2023
