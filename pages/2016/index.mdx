It is our great pleasure to invite you to the International Symposium of Computational Organometallic Catalysis (ICOC2016),
which will be held in Beijing, China, from 20 October to 23 October 2016. This is an international conference dedicated to
promoting advances in the integration of theoretical and computational chemistry with catalysis.

- The International Symposium on Computational Organometallic Catalysis 2016 (ICOC2016) focuses on the application of computational
  chemistry in homogeneous and hetergeneous organometallic catalysis. Advances covered range from new catalyzed reactions and processes,
  to ligand and catalyst design, and new mechanistic insights that can change implementation into practice.
- Participants include scientists involved in computational chemistry related to catalysis, organometallic chemistry, organic synthesis,
  and polymer synthesis, from both academia and industry. The ICOC2016 is trying to provide a platform to exchange academic ideas in this
  field with a highly engaged discussion. The single oral session and one poster session style for oral presentations and posters promote
  discussion and debate, as does the conference size (typically 100-150 participants).

## Important dates:

- Abstract Submission Deadline: Sept. 15, 2016
- Registration Deadline: Sept. 25, 2016
- Conference Date: Oct. 20-23, 2016
